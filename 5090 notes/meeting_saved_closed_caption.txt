08:33:40 So this is our third last class I believe this was our main.
08:33:55 Yeah, I think I'm going to do we have about two or three classes more I think. Yeah.
08:33:59 Yeah.
08:33:57 I realized we don't have time that's why I'm forcing myself.
08:34:02 First you know this doctor to do we don't really have a lot of time and there's quite a bit of stuff we still need to cover, especially under this model, the current model so that's why I absolutely want to cancel class.
08:34:19 So just anything else. So, thank you.
08:34:26 Okay, I think we have enough people here. We can probably start today, shared my screen.
08:34:34 Can everybody see ya.
08:34:45 Good.
08:34:45 Um, So people will join later.
08:34:50 So the black folks are basically Kelly is to
08:34:57 Basically, is to look at a
08:35:06 look at the keys that I find, and then also try to come up with some of the conceptual issues that we've been looking at either like for those ih more about, like, exposing.
08:35:20 Those of you who are not already familiar with some of those concepts. And some of those strategies. Oh, like you know technologies, you know, as a way of helping you to connect, some of the stuff they are doing in.
08:35:34 In the decline in classes the neural network architectures and the nlb classes, was the stuff, like you know stepping out into the industry, you're called upon to start the globe.
08:35:54 It's delicious. Sometimes you have to think about things from scratch, as I'm trying to propose things that your colleagues from the other, the other the other scientists may not have seen before.
08:36:02 So that's where I'm going like we are the web does have a role go for that second power down some things we will discuss.
08:36:11 I have not been able to manage their assignment one so that you recall that third piece to raise your hand record that some of you ran out of time, and then I extended a time so it's a big issue trying to make those two pieces so I can present the results
08:36:32 every time I did I lose data. I reached out to it to help me to figure this out but if like we tried a few things that didn't work. We feel bad no today's no way can I'm probably going to publish the first, like, I like just your grades, let you know
08:36:54 like how are you feeling about this is a talent have been dealing with for a couple of days.
08:37:00 And I don't see any clear way forward so I'm waiting for it to get back to me this morning hopefully after class written back with how I could match those, you know, two different phases right like so, you know, those of you who have like that in a moment
08:37:15 you you know have, like, you know, took advantage of that extra 10 minutes so that has been what has been the challenge that they've been hopefully we can study today.
08:37:29 Apart from that, I'll catch up on all the other material that needs to be created for assignment.
08:37:36 One.
08:37:39 I thought into grade and I'm almost done.
08:37:42 I did, I did.
08:37:45 The in class, the more I did the reading writing class so, but the, the report is worth taking a bit of time but I'll finish up and then I'll post those rates for next, next class.
08:37:59 And then those quizzes read you Next, Next week is going to be light which I don't intend it to be anything difficult, but I will send an email about it in terms of how to prepare the final stuff to work out for the format to December like maybe this
08:38:26 the material to focus on will be a lot different from the textbook stuff, but we will see.
08:38:29 Okay, so.
08:38:33 Any questions before we jump into the day.
08:38:36 Do we have any questions.
08:38:43 Nobody has questions.
08:38:45 Okay.
08:39:02 Alright.
08:38:50 So I did I sign up for today's class was for us to look at two cases involving chalkboard.
08:39:03 So those of you who take a look at who keep an eye on the, the course outline you realize that for today's class. I had to two different cases, they discussed when kids, you know, they both like you know in in the market and sector.
08:39:29 And then another case, what we will discuss the what I ended up was fine, it would be chapbooks in the HR sector right which are all functionality with that organizations deal with.
08:39:57 So, I had hoped that we would be able to extract a lot of
08:39:47 like complimentary and contrast and evidence from the two cases. But we don't have a lot of time, like I mentioned, we still have some conceptual issues to cover so I decided that we should just do this case, which has enough meat in there for us to get
08:40:04 to some of the things we would like to discuss and also some of the lessons from left to right.
08:40:11 So, This was about the deployment of a chatbot in an NHL station. You already the case that you prepared some comments and notes and so on so forth and I'm looking forward to delving into it soon.
08:40:26 But over there, the overall picture is that some of these templates are beginning to be applied in areas that we're not anticipated like many people think of tugboats and they think straight about fill up about customer service and marketing and customer
08:40:47 facing punctures right or customer facing
08:40:56 engagements right but as you can see in this case, you know, we can also have chalkboards doing things internally in the frame. And when we start doing things like you know tackling is using 10 Eileen defend the strategy is to be a little different approach
08:41:13 the problems we need to tackle tend to be a little different so that's the plan, like you know to focus on some of these things and to to reshape our thinking in terms of how we might approach that but, you know, If it's not like customer.
08:41:29 Right. Though the urban Runco, for, for our discussion today.
08:41:34 So we had.
08:41:37 I gave about I give out about six questions to help us spread.
08:41:42 I would like us to focus on the past four of them.
08:41:48 For the interest of time, so we can do justice to them, and then also have enough time to look at the second part.
08:41:55 And the way I want us to approach the questions. I know you've all prepared, but I want us to do, I'm going to do a breakout room.
08:42:04 And then the different groups would for the next 22 minutes, you know, you go into your group.
08:42:13 Your room, and then you have a discussion based on the notes you've had and so on and so forth.
08:42:18 And the questions for each group,
08:42:38 group one will go into one type of question one to route to question to group three like you see on the screen and then go for is going to room for, but to tackle question to question.
08:42:39 I want to see a second perspective, like you know from from from other people so that's why I'm assigning two to five will go into room five in, and toggle question for.
08:42:50 So you have 20 minutes, you know, to look at this and then when you come back, you nominate somebody decided on somebody who's going to present on your behalf.
08:43:01 By the way, group for is facilitating today's class, if I'm not mistaken.
08:43:06 We have members of group for here.
08:43:14 Someone from group for.
08:43:15 funding group for members can somebody come, can you raise your hand just indicate OKV. Ok.
08:43:32 Ok. Jerry is here as well. Okay so, yes well.
08:43:35 Okay.
08:43:35 Yeah. All right, let me. Okay, so, so do you. I all assume that you, you, you, you take the call the coordinator leadership role for, for, for your group, your group is facilitating today's class which means that you're taking notes and then you're also,
08:43:57 So your group is facilitating today's class which means that you're taking notes and then you are also, you know,
08:44:00 guys like you know, facilitating discussions when called upon and so so far. But I want you guys to focus on question to as well in your group discussions and then I'll see, I would like to see what you think, what would you propose that when we come
08:44:16 Question two as well in your group discussions and then I'll see, I would like to see what you think what what you propose that when we come back to the plenary we'll go through the questions and then I will also share some of suggested some suggested
08:44:27 answers, from my perspective, And then we will move on, there's any question.
08:44:34 Is there any question. Do we have any questions, go forth you have any questions.
08:44:44 Now for now, I think we're all right okay.
08:44:45 I'm going to create those groups, and then we'll go into.
08:44:51 You go into those groups as soon as they are.
08:45:04 Okay.
08:45:20 So I'm gonna give you the rooms.
08:45:13 I'm gonna open low their rooms and then you know yo yo group so just automatically, like you know, Join the room that you belong to. Okay.
08:45:25 I'll do it is actually I forgot to ask, what can you show me you are wearing.
08:45:33 Yeah, I'll put them on the screen.
08:45:35 Okay them on their screen here.
08:45:42 Okay, let me take a screenshot.
08:45:44 Yeah. Okay, so you can join Yo, yo, yo.
08:45:50 Everybody can join your rooms now.
09:11:19 Time to cancel.
09:11:19 Right.
09:11:19 Yeah.
09:11:20 Yeah. People went for a big conference coming back.
09:11:23 Okay, sounds good. Thank you.
09:11:28 We are back to their phones very diverse Actually I have one question. Yes.
09:11:36 Yes, I'm here. So what is the readings. What readings, do we have to do for Chris gic from the previous modules that we have chapter 12 in chapter nine.
09:11:46 Right. Mobile more about these three now I'm gonna send an email about it from there.
09:11:53 Three now I'm gonna send an email about it from there. Oh, no, I just wanted to know about the reading because in the previous class we didn't do anything so I was going to the class.
09:12:03 And are you talking about three. The one next week yes yeah that's what I'm saying I'll send me information about it after class so don't worry about it now.
09:12:12 Okay.
09:12:13 All right.
09:12:15 I'll send a lot of information about it. Okay.
09:12:18 Okay. Yeah.
09:12:23 Okay. Um, I suppose we are back now and
09:12:30 I'm sure I'm hoping that you have in your groups.
09:12:36 So let's jump straight up.
09:12:39 If you want to use as light as the last slide to present, especially those of you who might have some calculations, that's okay last will come up already.
09:12:50 I've already enabled screen sharing so just let us know if you want to use the flight. Otherwise, I'll try to talk to some of the things you see on the calendar on the slides, where possible, and then
09:13:14 we will also
09:13:11 try to
09:13:14 for doing this group folder so try to cover as much as possible. Okay.
09:13:21 doing this girl from folder so try to collect as much as possible. Okay. Okay. Let's start with group one group one, right.
09:13:27 That was asking for the importance of employee voice and stickiness, and why they're calling it based on these might be useful, and whether the practice should be sustained.
09:13:44 Iris. Yeah, so I can talk for our group. So we basically had a discussion.
09:13:50 So we all agree that employee voice is very important for several reasons.
09:13:56 One, obviously being if employees don't feel heard and don't feel valued, then they're not going to be motivated or experienced a certain level of job satisfaction and that in turn is going to affect the quality of the services they provide, how they
09:14:11 interact with others how they maintain the culture of the organization, and that will likely lead to attrition, which is a huge concern for organizations because it costs a lot more money to hire and retrain new stuff, then that will also affect the culture
09:14:28 of the organization and culture is really important now for both the employees and the customers and their perceptions of the organization and how ethical they are.
09:14:39 And, and such so we all agree that employee voice was very important also a way to kind of understand their experience beyond what upper management can understand.
09:14:56 Then we
09:14:56 come to a
09:15:01 commitment, I had to talk about commitment is all right. Um yeah so it makes them feel heard and makes them feel valued and it gives them a sense of purpose, which all which all will affect their level of motivation, and will affect their quality of the
09:15:20 services that they provide within their organization. And then it's probably one of the most important for maintaining and developing a culture in the organization and culture is very important for job satisfaction.
09:15:31 It's one of the most important factors for job satisfaction, and then job satisfaction is predictive of attrition are good.
09:15:46 could
09:15:55 have a book here and so I have to do with this character what you say Okay.
09:16:01 All right. So,
09:16:05 basically.
09:16:08 Yeah, yeah, I give in here would be that there are a lot of positives with employee voice that cannot be ignored.
09:16:16 And it's
09:16:19 like, it can lead to commitment, it can lead to, it can hope creates culture and organizational culture, which are pay satisfaction and thereby reduce potentially reduce attrition.
09:16:33 Right.
09:16:36 Does anybody disagree with this.
09:16:40 Does anybody has an adult he feels
09:16:48 so good for it out on the front is back to you. So, what did you think about all the Judas cars there. There are also the arrow that they found the way that that is the best approach.
09:17:04 What if we all agree that I'm for invoice important with a thought be the best approach, or how useful was it like in terms of whether you discuss the pros and cons or limitations.
09:17:18 Yeah, so we did, that's where we like, we had a bit more of a non disagreement but have a conversation out its pros and cons.
09:17:28 So obviously some pros are, it does give you a little bit of a window into the, you know, what's going on for the employees.
09:17:36 But there are a lot of limitations to it like in the case that mentioned that doing an annual survey is like taking the temperature of a person once a year and saying that they're healthy.
09:17:48 So, doesn't necessarily capture the does. So one, you know it doesn't necessarily how valid is that right like does it generalize to their overall experience.
09:17:57 There's also you know validity concerns in terms of honesty and how courageous people feel, or you know how safe people feel to share how they truly feel so how valid are those responses.
09:18:11 So those are some of the limitations and then we talked about you know what they could kind of do instead.
09:18:20 So of course, there needs to be some form of engagement. And so we talked about how it's very expensive to do the annual surveys and how often.
09:18:36 There might be a really long period of time before any changes are actually implemented by the time they go over all the results make sense of it and kind of discuss it as an organization in a way forward so for the perspective of the employees, it might
09:18:44 might not look like they're taking action. So that can lead to kind of resentment or, you know, what's the point of doing these surveys and over time that this could lead to less engagement with the surveys.
09:18:56 So we thought, you know what, for example, like if a company instead of spending all their money on hiring a company like this to do this entire survey.
09:19:05 What if they just spent this money on giving everyone, some freedom to take a mental health day like a day off like they trust their employees whenever they're not feeling well they have the freedom to take an extra Mental Health Day, and that money kind
09:19:17 of is in that pool instead. And we don't think anyone would be unhappy with more freedom to take a day like a mental health day in the case that mentioned that mental health and well being is a huge concern after the panda.
09:19:33 We also thought of what if they aged and in really coaching and training management to create very trusting relationships with their teams where there's kind of this free flowing psychological safety where the, where the employees can feel comfortable
09:19:53 and safe to share this with their manager because of this, in this, you know, relationship that they've built.
09:20:01 Instead of having kind of an anonymous chat box and that investment in turn will you know relationships is one of the best predictors of culture and how satisfied you are at the job so this might be a better investment than doing, you know, a chat box.
09:20:19 So.
09:20:22 So basically, you think about there are, like, maybe the best way to go like this, like, just in summary, so I stopped by like the gist of it is the chalkboard is not probably like and if there are ways that we can improve them, the employees sorry, then
09:20:43 the top but it's probably not the best way to go because they're afraid of competition of.
09:20:50 Once you guys discuss.
09:20:51 Yeah. So like for example if you if you tell the chat bot I'm happy, the chat box gonna take that as like face valid, like they're not, like, cuz I noticed that you know x y z versus a manager who sees you every day and how's everything going you say
09:21:08 it's okay, but then they can engage in that conversation with you'd be like well I've noticed that, you know, you seem down or you've been leaving early, like can we talk about that, and that would go, you know, much farther than just telling a chat bot
09:21:38 your okay and I'm believing you and give them that information to the organization. Okay.
09:21:31 Um, who has a different opinion, I'm you already the kid. So even if you didn't discuss this question immediately.
09:21:37 I like that, like the last point that was making through a race that are improving, which is that
09:21:56 instead of the chalkboard is probably a better option.
09:21:56 who thinks otherwise,
09:21:58 who has a different opinion. I'm hoping that somebody has a different opinion.
09:22:06 Do you have a different opinion.
09:22:08 Okay time.
09:22:10 Give it a try. So, I understand these points and I think these are very valid points, I see one point here that at times people are not comfortable in bringing out their issues at work and talk to management about it openly.
09:22:26 So it is a better way of communicating they have, you know, one to one or in person communication but depending on the personality of the people, or the nature of the issue.
09:22:36 People are not comfortable in that case, I feel that he can be very helpful.
09:22:48 Yes, please.
09:22:50 Yeah, I really liked the idea of taking a day off from putting money towards that. But then I also thought that that doesn't do much in terms of if there's a developmental need or something in the place of work that needs to be worked on right because
09:23:05 taking a day off, it would be a silent movement to yourself that you're just removing yourself from the problem. So if there is something specific to the workplace to your environment to your culture to even the technology that you're using or any part
09:23:17 of your standard operating procedures that needs to be changed, taking a day off. Wouldn't address that. So the chat bot has a better chance of fixing the problem, whereas a day off is like a band aid to the problem.
09:23:33 Okay.
09:23:33 Okay, thank you for, for the point
09:23:41 I want to make sure I'm capturing everything here. I'm Julie.
09:23:46 I hope you're doing something similar.
09:23:51 Make sure that I get some because I don't have a bug.
09:24:00 So you guys have something to consider for you and of course, I may not share my suggested. Sometimes the clouds your own wisdom, so I don't want to do that, when I, when I said a slide later.
09:24:08 Okay.
09:24:10 Okay, so thank you i think that this is great. I like I like that people have a different view of these things that I know that
09:24:21 that's the way you think about it, it's also shaped by maybe your experience with chat bots and.
09:24:28 For example, like in White Plains context and and also some of some other utilities that you think.
09:24:39 Right, so I can completely understand, everybody was like, with.
09:24:49 I was the same that like you know there are ways that we can improve the areas and their contact domains suggested by science and internet right, but I wanted to say that I wanted to.
09:25:05 I've got
09:25:08 a lot of things here. I've got this man.
09:25:11 I want to add that.
09:25:23 So, very early like I think all of you would agree that many of the points that are raised were valid in terms of how employee voice is important, right, and how it influences are going to come to.
09:25:32 She talked about building confidence, are feeling valued and so on and so forth. Right. Which, you know, all the things that she likes that we can we can substitute Amanda reinforcing the psychological contract with the organization.
09:25:49 And by improving commitment, which the. did she did explain right.
09:25:56 commitment, which the. Did she did explain right. The reason why I'm awake, you know, would be from a management perspective, or at least from my perspective would be the theories of reciprocity is too late.
09:26:09 that organization is meeting certain, certain obligations in terms of taking care of their consequently I won't be there and they will reciprocate with transparent commitment with organization so sociology, galaxies that they plow always calculating the
09:26:44 and said the cost benefit analysis cost benefit analysis and relationships, right event, and it's been observed in all sorts of relationships, you know, professional relationships romantic relationships.
09:26:44 Everywhere you have social relations being created, the two parties involved, you know attempt to evaluate the pros and cons or the, the, the, the cost benefit analysis right and once they come to the conclusion that you know the cost, the benefits of
09:27:01 being in a relationship. I weighed the cost of stepping out, then they like no they retain all the Republic, the republic kids, you know, the end of the bargain and so on and so forth.
09:27:19 Right, so so that theory, you know, sort of, supports yr given employee voice or engagement through, you know, I've been playing for, you know, I'm thrilled to to lead to positive outcomes for my fish.
09:27:28 Right. Then there's also the notion that they are more likely to in summary report is not a bad thing, per se. It's something that report for a long time.
09:27:39 Right.
09:27:39 And, and it's especially good like and I think my resource trying to highlight some of these points out from the discussion that, you know, you have all these focus group discussions that are part of it, which, like if you if you try to solve any organizational
09:27:55 issue, as a manager management level focus groups tend to be very very useful where people feel like they're talking in an open space. They're talking in a safe space they can build relationships sometimes, you know, when, when people are talking and
09:28:11 you, you, you.
09:28:14 Sometimes it might mean other things but facial expression can help explain like if you listen to their weights alone. If you read the emails that you might not get everything they're saying, but if you sit down with the chat with them and so on and so
09:28:26 forth. So I think that's where probably Iris, cool way of thinking that, you know, if we could develop these two, if we could develop this, and also be, you know, and fix all the problems.
09:28:40 Perhaps we could, we could, we could use it instead of the chalkboard. But the limitations tend to be quite great right so, so I don't know a way that it is possible to fix all of them, right, like if you think about it, you can think about the way the
09:28:58 questions are structured, you know, and how it is done with it. So, no matter how you structure your writing and stuff we basically you're gonna get a broad base sentiments does the best you can get you can really dive in and keep people are our personalized
09:29:15 response. Right.
09:29:16 And then if you think about a frequency which we did is collected I think that we are in agreement, Irish, and that, you know, you did mention that they have, you know, their one year into well like many things happening between a certain so far right,
09:29:33 so that's where they could, could be really helpful in terms of LinkedIn critical moments, you know, that happens in organizations and so on and so forth.
09:29:42 so I put out some of these
09:29:47 things to consider when I say this lights are just you know the things on there on the right side, I'll just keep the, the table there for, for you to think through and revise some of the things you were thinking, thinking about right.
09:30:01 So, so, so some of these example some of these limitations, you realize that if you, if you consider any other things that you could probably do for for the job but you could probably do for the, the, the, the design something they might not be able to
09:30:36 They might not be able to overcome all of these limitations, basically right so that's why they have the chat box approach may still be useful on top of the contributions that spans and a tiny bit right so so you keep, you keep that in mind.
09:30:38 Right.
09:30:41 Did you have any more comments or does anybody have a question one.
09:30:50 I can see that you're pondering a lot.
09:30:56 Okay.
09:30:58 Right.
09:31:00 So there's no more questions.
09:31:04 I will move to question two.
09:31:07 I had two groups, look at question two.
09:31:14 Can we help group to go first.
09:31:22 Sure, I will go first.
09:31:27 from YouTube. Um, okay so we talked about some, some business values that they can bring to a the HR department first increase the spontaneous, or on time response rate of the employee engagement.
09:31:44 This is to say that this is to say that the
09:31:50 by the response increased on time response rate response rate
09:32:00 for employee engagement. Okay, under, under, under a framework of five.
09:32:25 So this one
09:32:26 time, Almost quantity.
09:32:31 quantity quantity. Okay, human reaction. Okay.
09:32:38 Yeah, so this one, so this this value brings in the quote the quote the, quote, quantity up because it increases.
09:32:52 It gives more chance for employee to have a to have a.
09:32:59 Oh, okay.
09:33:02 To have the downtime response, rather than waiting for the annual annual the annual employee survey.
09:33:18 Okay. And also you have a nice smooth human interaction with it.
09:33:20 And then, And then human reaction human reaction. Right.
09:33:26 Okay, and also this one can help.
09:33:29 Help the HR department to focus on training upscaling and retaining the top talents are under the life cycle of the employees.
09:33:44 So we will focus on this part because, because the app from the from the, from the cases, it tells us that the app will only give the in place will pass that probation time.
09:34:01 This access to, to Amber.
09:34:03 So under the left Secretary lifecycle of the retaining talent, it works pretty well. Well, it gives HR department, a chance to to to retain these employees.
09:34:18 Okay. And this one.
09:34:21 This one really does well on the cost because you will give more.
09:34:26 You will allocate the resources allocate the resources to these particular.
09:34:34 This particular like critical pilots will put it further.
09:34:48 From focus on
09:34:48 practical approach.
09:34:50 Okay.
09:34:53 Right.
09:34:54 Okay.
09:35:26 Oh, and also we, we, we, we have another point that he saves time by automate with automate automate responding to employees automate respond. These are more related to your point, what about
09:35:17 his time is more like time saving
09:35:21 time and. Yeah.
09:35:24 No, it's not as not as not the same point because the previous point is more in more focused on retaining pilots, this one is sort of Jennifer's point, the, the one on the screen there as well.
09:35:39 Right, right, right, it actually is the. Yeah, it is actually the result from the. Okay, so we can say that, thats related to that point. Yeah.
09:35:48 And also gives a.
09:35:54 So, and then the employee seems to be happy, seems to be satisfied with this.
09:36:00 this.
09:36:05 Because from the, from the matrix we can tell there's 2600, oh five responded versus 71 drop conversation.
09:36:21 So I think this one works pretty well on the
09:36:27 quality of of this quality of this app. This app.
09:36:35 And the last one we have is, it helps to segment the employees with different segment, the employees into different
09:36:54 brand group.
09:36:58 Different engagement perspectives from Exodus, 12, we have, we can see that the there is, there are quite a few different.
09:37:11 There are quite a few different landscapes for Florida in place to fall in. So this, this app. This app can help to segment them into different level, so that the human resource can focus can have a more focused need.
09:37:31 Yeah.
09:37:33 Okay, thank you. Um, Do we have any more from before,
09:37:42 before.
09:37:45 Um, well I think, um, he pretty much covered a lot of stuff that we discussed. Can we just want to add maybe the scalability for this chat bot is pretty high, especially considering that if you want to implement, you know, lower level in person no surveys
09:38:03 in big companies with a lot of employees, it's going to be super costly. So, this chat bot is really very scalable very feasible. When it comes to that.
09:38:16 And also on, I think, like to also mention the human reaction, this, because this this bot is like very agile and it gives the organization HR department, more time to react to possible situations, or problems, that, that, that is labeled by the I for
09:38:44 example, if last time.
09:38:50 Last time, sorry, more time like, for example, if, like traditionally if some if the employee goes to the HR and and report is some problems, it will, it will usually be a more complicated process, but because this this chat bot also has a non anonymous.
09:39:13 Comment, like function. And so when, when the HR on ceased that common, it can react faster, instead of like going through all the processes, all the general normal process HR process so that by the HR and the company more time to really find out the
09:39:38 problem and to map out the solutions for the potential problems on. Yeah, and on whilst Do we have.
09:39:52 See, and also we also mentioned something like this see this chat by can also autumn automatically label on employees into groups like watch list, which also saves time, energy, money.
09:40:10 Um, yeah. because groups are pretty much cover what we discussed.
09:40:15 Yeah, but we use and I think they
09:40:19 call it a voice in two different levels. Okay. Yeah, yeah, right. Okay.
09:40:25 Yeah, but we do realize that on, there's a there's a lot of flaws.
09:40:33 And we actually discussed a lot about whether if this is this, this chat bot is like really ask the CO we're not giving certain circumstances, for example, okay do you we will get to the FX.
09:40:55 Oh, okay.
09:40:56 To the plenary to say,
09:40:56 But when we get there. I'd like to hear what you guys thought about it from your discussion. Okay.
09:41:02 Okay, thank you very much.
09:41:05 Did anyone else have different ideas about how you might demonstrate value in in the offering by Amber.
09:41:16 Yes you are. Anything
09:41:20 I can hear me.
09:41:21 Yes, Ethan yes we can hear you. Okay, so one additional point from the human resource bill is that now the hrs can take proactive measures, so they can take action before the, The employees leave, other than just way tend to have the employee table this
09:41:47 resignation. So they have.
09:41:51 So, we can take corrective measures like they can propose it raise or have deep conversations, things like that.
09:42:03 And the other one is so we learned this in the change a mandarin class. So this is a, an additional channel for communication so employees have an additional channel for feedback.
09:42:20 So yeah.
09:42:22 Yeah, so I think another value added is the
09:42:30 possibility for a non linearity.
09:42:34 I think that's an almost employee engagement service and also anonymous, but this provides this conversation type of anonymity rate for some stuff some home for some of the other stuff I know they say that you can your manager can see your name or something.
09:42:50 But, but there is a whistleblower function to that could help. Yeah, yeah.
09:42:59 Okay.
09:43:01 Instead of adding names.
09:43:14 Good to see.
09:43:07 Okay, Thank you. Yes.
09:43:10 So, I second these points by giving the reference of the case of our last score in general.
09:43:19 And people were not happy and but they had absolutely no channel to voice their concerns, and people started leaving and they were stressed out and I think that's a perfect scenario for us to say that AI based chalkboard is is really good for situations
09:43:37 Abs chalkboard is is really good for situations like that provides another channel. Yeah.
09:43:40 Okay.
09:43:46 Now communication technology. Yeah. And then we'll we'll quickly.
09:43:49 Oh, sure, sure, I just have some different perspective, regarding to what Sri have brought up the possibility for an entity. I think having this app to be able to target on the particular employees is a key point for this software because if the all these
09:44:09 feedback are anonymous anonymous, it was detriment. The, the, for example the proactive measures can be done HR for for particular employees.
09:44:24 Actually, yeah, and then also you can see from the one of the example of that chat in knows who the employees are.
09:44:34 Yeah. So, here is no absolute anonymity right and say that they all like at least two people, minimum of one or two people in the organization.
09:44:50 It is any would be the CEO or the, the, the chief HR officer right either the chief executive officer the chief HR officer. And then, like, if they decide to delegate large organizations that can say that in large organizations, typically dedicated to
09:45:08 to the department heads, right. So, absolutely.
09:45:13 I agree with you. The point I'm making that without like without me to tell us know no possibility to innovate, you know that point about proactive measures come awake, so the agenda right on that front.
09:45:28 but on the other side.
09:45:30 You can think about typically the Wi Fi sometimes goes through go through a lot of people like you know if you think about the dispensary, you know, a lot of people will be involved.
09:45:43 In summary, you know, a lot of people will be involved. You have to actually manually, you know, flu the surveys keep them up. People have to collect it as when So for right so I think that's where as you realize, going into like does a reduction in in
09:45:58 that your exposure to the number of the.
09:46:00 That's right. So, think about it from that perspective young right but you know just appreciate the context of balancing, like how many people are actually involved in the process, how many people actually get to see with the world.
09:46:15 But if this is making it so that so far right, to reduce that risk of.
09:46:21 Thank you everyone I think that this was a good engagement with their with their with their particular question.
09:46:34 The one thing I think that the way I approached it when I was thinking about the kids.
09:46:42 And I was thinking about potential solutions, would be.
09:46:48 So most of the things you do describe what out to them and from a strategy perspective, right, like you can think you remember when we did
09:47:03 technology in Australia, when we did, we talked about strategies for technology solutions.
09:47:10 Right
09:47:13 there. I believe
09:47:16 in that talk to so please for follow up on that as well.
09:47:23 The agility and speed of decision making, that the critical competitive advantage. Remember we said that when you use technology one of the dangers is always the fact that people can be to you.
09:47:37 Right. So you always want to what we call strategic positioning of the technology in your business. To avoid this problem while to at least minimize this problem so that front, like many of you talked about the pic response like
09:47:56 to emphasize it, and I'm sure many of you read a case without realize that that's an easy win for for ama right.
09:48:05 And then, but the issue there is that once you get an insight, you know how you translate it into action depends a lot on the child's capability and intent, which is a problem that is not domesticated to HR systems that alone right every time because
09:48:32 from last time I always emphasize the need to do this abstraction from the solutions we would get from a systems, you know, in terms of deploying them a lot to me like having domain knowledge in swimming so far right.
09:48:43 So we faced have to come up with some KPI so some practice for employee engagement, and then based on those, you know strategic practice we can bounce the UK we I've been waiting on these like to see how we deliver as compared to like the, the overall
09:49:09 men Sunday, right. So that's what I present my Muslim said, you know, think nicely over there. Right. I was also hoping that some of you would like.
09:49:13 Some of you would think about actually doing the calculation for a return on investment right. We've seen that in a couple of classes in the past that, whenever you have as a bit and you have numbers.
09:49:27 It's always a good idea to try to, to to do some backup and low calculations you know make some reasonable assumptions, you know, and come up with because there's nothing that beats, you know, defending your key so defect the making that case for a product
09:49:47 done, presenting members, you know, to the blog to the board of directors or to your to your management team, right. So, one way you can approach it is from their strategy resources so a resource is Moodle, like remember we discussed the resource based
09:50:01 model right. And if we're lucky employers as non substitute, and costly to replace then retaining them becomes a priority and defensive about right.
09:50:14 Like you know one of the advantages of the it helps us identify these employees right and then we can now if we know who they are. We can use the cost of acquisition of these critical high potential talent, you know as a mess out the value of paid by
09:50:43 right. So, this is the kind of a readout has been adopted, like when you look at the, the kids, they have as a bit nine and they show some statistics there. And then they give us some metrics around.
09:51:02 and lessons, right. So, basically, we can do here is for the first part is strategic positioning pads. We can look at all of these different goals some strategic HR goals, which many of the comments that the gentleman, actually mentioned, as well as
09:51:18 all the contributions that kid you know you can't fit them somewhere.
09:51:23 These strategic goals like improve communications right like it means adding additional communication channels and so on and so forth. Right. And so, and all these kind of things you can you can like you know rates, like look at the way about wait and
09:51:39 see whether your fancy sense or not. So that's one way to go about, like, you know, addressing the value from a strategic positioning perspective.
09:51:49 The other way to go about it, is to look at the metrics, or like your additional which boys, look at the metrics that you know they presented, you know, given you to talk through the platform.
09:52:03 How many actually chatted with Amber, and so on and so forth. Right. And then you tease out the most important information for for for companies that are out right so the idea would be that, you know, the platform cost about 11 K a year, and you have
09:52:21 that information in the case and total at risk employees that are identified as 145, which include current and ex employees, How do we know the ex employees well.
09:52:50 who are not engaged or disengaged.
09:52:53 What they do is that they they notify whoever has access to, to the records or they're always getting the daily reports, you know, and then they can actually go in and say okay, we have spoken to this person and so we are removing that pastor from x rays
09:53:14 so we are moving that place person from open or something like so they can basically, close the case right. So, this is the data that he gave us from from that exhibit.
09:53:30 You know, we as you that maybe 50% of those employees, you know, our current like their current employees that it means that they spoke to them, they were identified by the, by the way, spoken to by these are all the way makes you know the idea issues
09:53:45 were discussed and. The same happens to the theme, right, and then 20, employees, you know, even after talking to them, they were not happy so they may have left, right, and then like there's about 67 employees, current.
09:54:02 And the reason why some people were speaking to is because there are people who actually like tungesvik right there, could you can, you could have employees who you're hoping to leave on your own by natural attrition, you sometimes you have people who
09:54:18 are so long. They seem to know everything and afraid to call to, to, to change their mind with anything and be a bad influence on new comics right so for those people, and it's not exactly fair to just let them go, because they might be around for a long
09:54:35 time so if they decide to go on their own, you just let them go quietly so you don't want to talk to everybody right that that does the idea so. So that's why you know some people I was put into the assumption here, and this is purely based on.
09:54:50 You have to, you have to know their industry you have to know what I took about domain knowledge, this is where, you know, some of these assumptions, come into play.
09:55:13 Like, you need to know their, their industry you know your staff and make the right assumption. Also, based on the tool that you have right if you know that predictive accuracy of Amber, for example, to be around like 60 70% and so on and so forth.
09:55:15 You know there's several factors that go into this assumption about how many people like you know you think you want to retain right you want your people to meet and those you want to retain.
09:55:26 And then you also have to consider the average cost of the company of the employee which would be other even Racing's you have to pay that their salary and the benefits and everything related to keeping the employee for one year right and then some of
09:55:41 these, depending on the industry you can get them from indeed you can get them from so many
09:55:49 platforms out there that monitor these days. Right, so you can get a quick estimate from there. And then you can also do a conservative conservative conservative bit of feeling.
09:56:02 Right. So typically, is put out 20% of the cost to the company right. So if you have that.
09:56:09 If you have all that then you can actually calculate the things that have been made, right, which will be the number of employees that, you know, identify risk I was booking two times, you know, the cost of filling these people time to 60% of, you know,
09:56:28 people that you want to retain basically right. And then, if you do that and you get like the savings me then the return on investment from those savings over the how much it costs, right.
09:56:41 So, so I will leave this calculation there for you to ponder about a point you get it but your point is that it's always a good idea to have some sort of found.
09:56:56 I'm says, based on those assumptions, do a rough calculation, it might not be the perfect, but you come back up all the soft tissues, their previous slide.
09:57:08 When I was taking the notes with some concrete hard numbers that helps your kids a lot, right.
09:57:16 Yeah, so that's the idea. This doesn't mean that this these fundamentals are these metrics for these numbers for different organizations, it depends on the organization, and the specific issues that happens organizations.
09:57:34 Yes.
09:57:36 So, the conservative estimate for the constant backfill 20% of annual CDC.
09:57:42 Could you explain why how you came to the assumption of 20%. Oh, it's an industry like you see the government also follows up on this.
09:57:53 And they give you an idea of how much it costs to fill a position for example if you were This is like your one of your senior managers were living with your post how much it will cost to recruit someone else to fill that post right.
09:58:08 This is for one person right. Yes, this would be cool for one person that's why we're multiplying it by six.
09:58:15 Okay. Exactly. Yeah.
09:58:18 Got it.
09:58:32 No, that's also that's I'm saying that it's also from a skill. So that's I'm saying you have to look at it industry averages and, indeed, So many platforms that track these things right.
09:58:36 So it's 5859 59.
09:58:44 Oh, here
09:58:50 it is like the average cost, you know to like the, the console for one year.
09:59:08 out of my pockets or stuff like that is how one truck bridge. Some of these back of the envelope calculations. Right.
09:59:13 Right.
09:59:14 Okay.
09:59:27 Should we take a quick break and resume, I can see a little tired Oh yes, please.
09:59:22 Yeah. Very good, very good. Yes, yes. Okay.
09:59:27 Five minutes break and then we'll be back.
09:59:30 Right.
09:59:52 The winners
09:59:59 thought into rain. Yeah.
10:00:02 Hey, can you hear me straight here. Yes sir yes I can hear you do, I'm just trying to trying to make sense of formula. Yeah.
10:00:12 So, 58 people who were saving at risk employees. Yeah.
10:00:19 And 11.8 is the cost to backfill.
10:00:38 one or 2% of them all let's say there is somebody who not only identifying like 40% of the time is from physicality, right, that is the assumption. Right, right, based on some sort of.
10:01:06 So, so the idea is that why is it 58 times and not 145 times this 145 is the potential.
10:01:15 No. Maybe we can subtract x employees.
10:01:18 The, the 145.
10:01:22 We didn't speak to those six to seven people right, we spoke to 15 plus 20 that 78 people.
10:01:30 And we were able to retain about 50 people, right. So, the assumption is that we want to see their like if, how much would have cost to to retain this system percent of these 38 instead of 60% or one foot five.
10:01:50 Okay.
10:01:53 The reason it's conservative 60% 100%.
10:01:58 Yes, yes okay okay yeah 60% of 50 people.
10:02:06 And each of those people cost, 11.8. Exactly. Okay. Thank you.
10:06:22 Right.
10:06:24 Can we resume, people back already.
10:06:31 All right, thank you.
10:06:38 Okay.
10:06:40 Okay. Thank you, sir.
10:06:44 All right, thank you.
10:06:46 So, the question, basically is looking at what kind of changes are breaking into their HR profession as an HR business partner right. And whether you know it is replacing or maintain the role of HR, right, you can think about it, you know from that perspective.
10:07:12 And the second part of the question is asking about what kind of capabilities competencies need to change or how the HR function needs to change. For amber to work best.
10:07:30 Basically, like if I were to rephrase the question right. So, can we have three walk us through the I think and how they approach the question.
10:07:46 So we thought of it, in the sense that it really depends on the organization's. Oh yes this is this really depends on the organization structure because some organizations have HR diligently follow up regarding the mental health or the well being of the
10:08:00 employees and some don't. And in those case in the, in the cases where organizations do follow up.
10:08:08 We said that there won't be any substantial or drastic change in numbers but like, for example, a size of 20 people from HR who follow up on employees.
10:08:22 It might be downsized to like 15 to 18, not very drastic but a little.
10:08:29 In, in terms of manpower, or woman power.
10:08:33 And we also said that
10:08:39 down properly. For those who do have some structure that follows up on well being. You mean there might be a drop of them may not be a drop, there might be a slight drop.
10:08:53 Okay. Please go ahead.
10:08:56 And then we also should I jump to the next question.
10:09:01 Okay.
10:09:03 Oh, the what are the capabilities and accomplish.
10:09:08 So this is all you said about the first part of the question. Okay.
10:09:12 Uh huh.
10:09:14 Oh yeah for that one we said that since ambers only like we thought of amber as something that collects data and just puts that in we HR isn't necessarily.
10:09:30 They don't need to change any competency or capabilities, other than the fact that they need to be able to look at the data on the dashboard understand it and analyze it, they need to have that sort of capability, but other than that we don't see or foresee
10:09:45 any other drastic changes in their competency and capabilities. The reason being is that they're not operating Amber, or they're not maintaining Amber, one on one they're just using it as a metric or a way to collect information and understand it.
10:10:07 Okay.
10:10:11 Yeah, like only the one thing that they need to be able to do data analysis, be able to look at the data, understand it and analyze it, because amber puts everything on the dashboard.
10:10:27 Okay.
10:10:30 All right.
10:10:35 Well, we'll come in from the question.
10:10:38 And then also, based on what actions to Bill have to think about the fact that will actions they need to take based on the analysis have gotten so we could yeah we'll put that in as well
10:10:56 have a different opinion on that capability to face. They said that the Olivia. It depends on the organization that's
10:11:06 on the organization.
10:11:10 Let me put this point down first and then I can come back to what action to take based on.
10:11:25 Okay so grew three is suggesting that some organizations that already have, well being, programs, you know, for those organizations they might be slightly affected if they implemented Amber, because then they wouldn't need all the staff either well being
10:11:44 department.
10:11:45 Supposedly right.
10:11:48 then there might be a slide from there might be a slight drop in, in, in their HR professionals, if you like, but they also content that day, does know Firstly, they don't foresee any changes in competencies, because of the way the HR people are our mentors
10:12:20 us Arbor. Does anybody have different opinions on this.
10:12:20 Any other ideas on.
10:12:26 So, you all agree with that, is I was dying on.
10:12:32 Should I assume that you all agree with me on this.
10:12:41 Yes.
10:12:42 All right, I give it a try. So, I feel it really depends.
10:12:47 That what organize what organization objectives are to achieve.
10:12:53 Because organizations don't say oh it's IBS chat board let's go for it.
10:12:58 There is some objective they want to achieve and there are also always measurable goals to for those measurable goals to, to reach the point. So, I don't think that by having the data we are by placing in the chat boat, or by having the data is is a huge
10:13:20 a huge thing what we are going to do and what objective we want to achieve, it's, it's more important. So we can say that we won't see drastic changes in competencies just because we have implemented a chat board.
10:13:34 What we are going to do it that data is actually more important.
10:13:50 Um, you know that. Thank you, Tanya. Any other comments.
10:13:56 Any ideas.
10:14:13 I'm trying to talk to her words.
10:14:26 Tanya.
10:14:30 So, I'm
10:14:30 one of the things I want to, I would like you to always keep in mind has been three like some of these questions, didn't look simple on the surface, but actually when you try to.
10:14:48 If you are praised them.
10:14:50 Like a bit more in a modern ones where you realize that the answers are not that simple, right. So, like you identify some points here.
10:15:02 But, for example like we're against to capability changes for example like Tommy, like you know, bringing me something that I don't know if it costs $1, because once you put a technology, the thing we do with technology is that if you, if all you see
10:15:21 is the output of the technology, then you might assume that you don't really need to know how to use the technology right and and not like this answer seems to suggest that, that's all the HR people need to know.
10:15:35 But when you think about having technology in that environment and influencing goals, like, like, Tanya, was suggesting they realize that the impact goes much deeper, and therefore they're the cause of the team doesn't just end with the insights it's
10:15:55 not enough that like they know how to, how to interpret the dashboard they didn't know what actions to take. They have to think about what happens after they've taken that action, and even before they take that action right and, like, you know, they have
10:16:09 to think both horizontally and vertically, about what that is, it means for the way they practice their profession, right. So what about technology, and machines and collaboration, they, their their their repercussions are the competency changes.
10:16:28 You know, they tend to be a bit more than we tend to things like this thinking that oh we need to know, is to be adept at using the technology, that kind of thing can help swing for a long time, and the downside has been that we know we are very good
10:16:44 at the technology, but we are very, we tend to be a lot unfortunately we tend to feel cited on there like you know the potential impact of their of their technology, right.
10:16:55 So I want you to always keep that in mind when you have to analyze these types of things like these types of questions from a managerial perspective, right.
10:17:05 So one of the approaches,
10:17:10 my views, one of the approaches to thinking about this is you know, thinking about
10:17:19 what the what, what he what he does right they have the transactional parts of their way to production is that I think that checkbox checkbox related stuff, right.
10:17:33 When it comes to check him out and play well being and so on and so forth. And then, you know, there are things that require a bit more problem solving a bit more employee I did better place sentiment analysis, and so on and so forth.
10:18:02 So far right. So the bills there. If you like to preach not part of gathering data like you know crunching data and those kind of things. You know, that's where I'm like you know day I jump over to that there's already some, some workflow reduction going
10:18:20 you can think about it from that perspective. And then he can save the Russo by doing that as we see technology to especially IPS technology to more and more, you know, they take care of the transactional the routine aspect of their of the week.
10:18:21 And then you believe you, you leave that I'm sorry that professionals to, to raise your hand to deal with a more cognitively challenging part of your way like problem solving for example like problem solving, you know, depends the most of negotiations
10:18:40 depends a lot of meetings a lot of, you know, building consensus and those kind of things right. And then, like, you know, managing the thing to do. Right, so, so there will be some, some shift from from that perspective, like from the reporting aspect
10:19:06 of things, you know, two more the more problem solving, stuff that needs to happen right. And then, I believe that the gentleman in the head. Yeah, also mentioned the fact that, you know, there will be direction of attention to specific employees to home
10:19:14 At home we need to invest time and effort. So, so that goes back to the fact that it may result in reduction of professionals required right but I attempt to answer it depends on the organization if they were already in there already had.
10:19:32 Call it a very big, very big.
10:19:39 A very big, very big. Well, being a terrifying to perhaps we might not need a lot of them, you know, because many of the collection anyways, right, data collection and granted and, you know, conducting this diabetes if we have on by we don't need them
10:20:09 and see through by think through what kind of capabilities and competencies, you know i tend you know i required right. So in this particular instance, you can think about how, you know, the entire world is changing.
10:20:25 Right. I remember when I was somewhat mentioned about something you will let him in.
10:20:29 specialists right you know who just specialize in HR, finance and boundary I thought, more like you know line managers right you know line managers in terms of, you know, business line, right, and a business line will typically include more than just
10:20:58 people from from from the top right, you have to think about it from that perspective, and so on and so forth. And what it means that some of the changes required by by the, like, you know, implementation will be that for example like when it comes to
10:21:20 focus, you know, the traditional HR approach to focus on employee relations right now.
10:21:21 Sorry I think about partnerships with Italia, and now.
10:21:26 Customers which means that you know there is the need for, you know,
10:21:30 the entire function or the HR staff to be able to respond to employee concerns. Quickly, right, and let it reset relationships with
10:21:45 different managers in the organization right. I believe someone that bring this up right, I'm gonna leave this like they're, like, you know, just to compliment.
10:21:54 Some of the things that were three suggested but you get an idea that you need to approach, like you have to break down, you know, to see what kind of capabilities, you need to break down what what I did, current required capability so competencies for
10:22:14 you to to HR awake well, and then you think about what it means for a professional to do it well when it's Waking the professionals working hand in hand with technology.
10:22:26 So that's one of the things that I want you to keep in mind, three later when you get a slide I'm going to keep this this slide there for, for you to think about it.
10:22:40 Go ahead.
10:22:40 I'm sorry I still don't fully understand the changes required by HR.
10:22:50 So, if you think about the traditional way that we performed Hi, like, for example, we tend to think about the HR function as being responsible for employee relations, right, the focus would be very frank sinatra HR stuff, they have to focus on employee
10:23:13 relations, right. So everything that has to do with their employees.
10:23:20 How do you call it the organization's relationship with it, employee is considered to be a 40, then the when we think about strategy guitar, which, like and strategic HR is like you know one of the reasons why
10:23:37 some becoming more and more popular is because we are moving from traditional HR to the strategic HR approved right where we think more about partnerships with internal and external customers so the idea is no longer about just
10:23:56 sort of transactional transactional relationship right. you do this I do that for you, the HR policies that do X, Y Zed, and therefore like you know, if you're funny like you.
10:24:21 I think they're both excellent and so far right, we are thinking more about, if there are situations where we have to adjust to specific concerns that you may have.
10:24:21 Maybe my diversity concerns concept, it might be, you know, an issue that like your voice is not being heard or you, you feel like you're in the minority in the organization or you're, like, it could be several issues right you know so the competencies
10:24:31 that a professional needs to have now to be able to deploy because they're the time but it's deployed to support strategic HR function so strategic HR approach.
10:24:46 So the competencies that a traditional HR stuff needs to build now would be the ability to quickly respond to employee concerns. Right, that's that's what we're talking about isn't clear.
10:25:00 So essentially today. By using a chip in a chatbot.
10:25:05 We're freeing up time and resources for HR to move from being traditional to strategic.
10:25:13 If you got to think about it from that perspective, but what it means is that free time doesn't mean to magically, they will become strategic, they have to build some competencies with our freedom.
10:25:24 Freedom time, so that they can do what a strategic HR stuff requires them to do. Right. And as some of the changes that we, we were less than that they need to build those additional capacity capacity that they didn't have before.
10:25:41 So, just have to understand this table essentially but the two they have to do the changes that you've listed under the third column.
10:25:50 I just did changes suggested changes to the very last column. And the last the last column, and billions upgrades and exactly the same to detect column.
10:25:59 Okay. The third so okay so that would. Okay.
10:26:03 Thank you.
10:26:04 All right. Okay.
10:26:06 Okay.
10:26:13 The last question. Oh, yeah.
10:26:16 Let's look at the last question. Briefly, and then we would
10:26:22 maybe take her. we're just so we can continue, I think.
10:26:28 So the last question is asking about ethical concerns.
10:26:34 I know we have one class on ethics. I'm trying to get
10:26:41 a guest speaker to join us for that class. So I did not come from my next week if we can get them. But we have a whole class and I think so, this is just there.
10:26:52 If you like a segue into that class.
10:26:54 And I know that you probably had a whole course on ethics to sue. This is have a lot to say about this question right before I went to do for 535.
10:27:09 Tell me what you thought about this person. Any ethical concerns that emerged from the US Obama.
10:27:17 Yes.
10:27:19 Okay, so our group come up with the three aspects.
10:27:26 First one is.
10:27:29 So he my introduced bias. So, so, because you mentioned the case that what
10:27:40 they, they, employees feel discriminated when they are, they are chosen to communicate with was Amber, and then.
10:27:56 And when someone else can have at their, you know, time stage.
10:28:03 They can and then others cannot then they there's they they feel that they are treating differently.
10:28:10 And then there's also after covered. So you say, Have this.
10:28:21 Improve amber to handle mental issues, then there's a potential differential treatment of that may that may introduce bias as well.
10:28:30 And then there The second aspect is privacy.
10:28:36 So the issue first issue is misuse of information so the case, said that some HR professionals will use the wires that the employees use that in, in the conversation with Amber.
10:28:56 While while talking to them, this seems like this should not be happening is they should not the HR professionals should not know the Commerce, the detailed conversation right so only the.
10:29:17 One is that mid breach, what confidentiality anonymity Yes, yes. So, which one is it I mean, I'm a limit to your confidentiality
10:29:26 confidentiality. Okay.
10:29:30 Okay.
10:29:33 Um, Because not all
10:29:44 our stops you
10:29:44 know exactly what.
10:30:02 to buy exactly what
10:30:09 employees.
10:30:12 Okay.
10:30:13 Okay.
10:30:15 Yeah. The third point is data handling. So, because if you know a SAS companies are all the information stored at in fetal because there is a benchmark right in order to have a benchmark you need to process all the information and what if there's a security
10:30:34 issue all the data. All the employee information all the conversation history colleagues and that would be a problem. No.
10:30:47 Okay.
10:30:56 So, Why mobile
10:30:58 now.
10:31:23 Okay.
10:31:25 Yes.
10:31:32 Junior.
10:31:30 I want to ethics
10:31:37 Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. So, um, for the ethical concerns for this algorithm, um, I guess.
10:31:46 There are some certain occasions where the human involvement is necessary for example, on, if you have like for example, sexual assault during work. And that's something you definitely want to talk with actual HR professional.
10:31:59 They just because first of all, confidentiality concerns, and also it's very personal, and also on, I think from a legal perspective for certain locations such as the like crime related locations.
10:32:28 You are supposed to talk with actual human beings instead of on like have comments. Yeah, with just a bot because if I remember correctly, because I used to work in a law firm.
10:32:44 So everything related to like confidentiality, you are supposed to talk with a legal professional and you're supposed to have all your comments or on conversations on being recognized, like, a front.
10:33:10 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So I think this is a very huge concern for this AI because, first we don't have any religion regulations and laws regarding the confidentiality and privacy.
10:33:28 When it comes to HR chat bot.
10:33:31 And second of all, um, it's just sometimes it's just not enough to only have a chat bot certain very serious occasions. Yeah, and also the. Another thing I want to add for as a public concern is that I think on is, I think maybe this is a breach to on,
10:33:58 like, I from my personal perspective, I think this is kind of micromanagement style. Like, if you're trying to implement this kind of chat bot like too often, your employees.
10:34:11 For example you. For me, I really do not want to have like a two minutes chat session was with algorithms like once a week or something. I think that's just very annoying and that's very macro manager role, and I do not want that I think that's actually
10:34:28 bad for the working culture and working environment in general. So, yeah, I think, yeah, that's basically why I want to add.
10:34:38 Okay, thank you
10:34:42 very insightful point.
10:34:45 Yes, sir. Yeah.
10:34:50 Please go ahead. Yeah, I think one of the concerns in the beginning, with respect to the at risk employees not responding to ambers initiation with conversation.
10:34:59 That was associated with one type of risk, but then during coded. When that trend went down even further.
10:35:10 They associated that to mental health, mental stress, resulting pandemic right. So I mean, even the tone of amber needs to be adapted to the situation you don't want something you don't want to say something really tone deaf like oh I hope you're doing
10:35:25 great today.
10:35:27 When you're clearly suffering. So, yeah, yeah.
10:35:32 Okay.
10:35:36 Well, good work.
10:35:38 Yep.
10:35:47 Okay, thank you.
10:35:51 Okay, thank you. Um, any final comments I think but you got this one page nail down nicely. And it shows that you've actually, you actually did take that very seriously.
10:36:02 we just great.
10:36:07 Looking forward to our class, who have been very thankful to be so.
10:36:21 so, um, in terms of what I wanted to add to all the good points, you, you, you do have here, you pretty much covered most of the things that I saw in the kids as well.
10:36:35 So, a few more things that I wanted to highlight the escape attention was the idea that whether I'm by the big factors in cultural diversity or language comprehension ability, right.
10:36:51 So, I mean, does that sounds like, This is an India. I'm assuming they do speak English of course. But that would not be their first language, right. So, as it as I'm saying that like is as I'm saying that everybody has to such a level of, you know, comprehension
10:37:09 of English like how do we know the level of English that Amber, you know, is communicating with right so that's something to think about, right, like if we have more information about what is a high school level English your middle school level English
10:37:27 your best level English, you know, depending on wherever you pick up gets you maybe, you know, people who haven't attained that level of education in the organization, you know, opted out of the other rich right.
10:37:45 And then the other concept that like, you know, I noticed was when they use the CEOs email id ID for introduction. You know, I thought I thought that it could be Mr presentation right from a communication standpoint, you know, I'm widens just on my introduce
10:38:01 itself as, you know, a chat bot, like a friendly chat book. Why do you use the, the use email, you know, for, for that introduction. So,
10:38:16 although some composition going on there too so.
10:38:23 So keep an eye on the chat, that, you know, could be unethical point of discussion right in terms of communication.
10:38:33 And then there's this whole issue of confidentiality and anonymity I think we did. We spoken at length about it, like you know, whether you know this, you're saying, and, and it's our heads you delegate continue selling food to to practice law department
10:38:50 heads right and there are some challenges there right a bunch of bad, you say something confidentially negative about your boss, your immediate supervisor, and then they end up seeing it as well, right.
10:39:13 So, we are not very sure like Alice I couldn't see, you know, how, what kind of structures are being put in place beyond our best implementation to ensure that this is happening right it seems like this has to be this has to be a decision but as they
10:39:21 can in house. And if like for example like all of the managers to say that they don't want to hear about negative stuff about themselves, you know they can pretty much influence the whole system right.
10:39:33 And then the last thing I wanted to, to raise was whether their physical appearance of, like, you know, has anything to do with how people engage with a bride.
10:39:46 And I wanted to bring this point.
10:39:50 For example, no way to sell these things to the oven soon. Right.
10:39:55 So, so do you think that people will react would have reacted differently.
10:40:05 If it was not just like if it was
10:40:11 like if it was designed around interacting with people. What do you think any ideas.
10:40:23 Yes, my show
10:40:30 you another question. Try repeat the question I'm asking whether people would have reacted differently to Amber.
10:40:53 If it was presented in a different format or like the for example like a, like a composition robot, like a robot that approaches you to talk to you.
10:40:53 I mean, anybody.
10:40:56 Yes, sir. Yeah.
10:41:00 Um, I think, with a chatbot you can kind of get away with pretending almost to the other person is human on the other end.
10:41:09 And it's an actual robot, metal, trying to talk to you about your feelings.
10:41:16 It's an actual robot, metal, trying to talk to you about your feelings. It's probably not easy to digest and easy to divulge information, maybe my opinion. Okay, everyone else things, but what what other people think.
10:41:29 Yes, I'm. Listen, I think, if it's a chatbot is designed to be a physical one that people are feeling that they're talking to a real a real objects, or maybe similar to human.
10:41:49 There are more willing to reveal their feelings. Okay. Yeah, because maybe only chatting with chat bots on a website is similar to people, texting with other humans through the social media platforms that.
10:42:09 And they're not on filling on the real existence of the other one so they may nickel x, some of the feelings.
10:42:21 And just like the robots nowadays are designed to deliver fluids to people. And, as I saw people are expressing huge interest to them treated like a real person.
10:42:36 So, I think is important to consider the form of the chalkboard interesting design. Okay, so keep those in mind, unless we go back to do you need a break.
10:42:54 Do you need a break, again.
10:42:56 Okay, we move on.
10:42:58 I only have a few more things to cover and then we'll, we'll go K so just bear with me.
10:43:07 I like the opposing views from she is from Sri ization.
10:43:13 Um, so keep that in mind, we'll go back to it.
10:43:16 The last bit of stuff I wanted to go through and then we can close this model properly would be a few technologies that, you know, we can consider for Tomas, and that we need to collaborate with, right.
10:43:36 And I'd like to start by discussing a company that does somebody intelligence which goes right back to the question, but the last question that
10:43:48 we're contributing to.
10:43:50 So are these concepts familiar to anybody
10:43:54 know, have you have you come across them in any of your readings or you're like everybody that is that funny they do.
10:44:11 Okay, so while we talk about the somebody that we are talking about, okay my thought is, please go ahead. Yeah, yeah, I think we kind of have like a basic idea about what it is.
10:44:24 So it's basically like you know, it's like an intelligent like a system or an agent that interacts with the, with everyone with the environmental like a physical body, within that environment.
10:44:45 There are money there, and bodies. Yeah.
10:44:46 Talking about the one before Thank you myself. So that is somebody that would be our examples would be Syria My legs are your boy, you ask them for things and then they talk to you.
10:45:01 They have conversations with you but you don't have a physical form of them anywhere right like you come out like, for example, like, if this. Some say especially some time.
10:45:13 Like that they are not like many. When you go, they don't have a personality, they don't have, how they call it our episode if you like they just started getting with us to you without responses to some of your content so on and so forth.
10:45:24 Right. So those are generally December.
10:45:30 And then there I'm buddy James, you know when you have the sensuality of body James, you know where you can think about, for example like in games for example when you have our tasks that are designed to, to, to do special things all around and certain
10:45:46 so far right, and then you can lose out there Charlie body they are physically embodied, right, like the robots that we talked about, like, you know, so the reason why we care about these things is because there's a lot of research that suggests that
10:46:02 when you design AI solutions, how you deploy them within a collaborative system like human collaborative system, you know goes a long way to determine how people react to it, we had from the song about how people like my react better, if there are any
10:46:22 new feed or if I was like a robot that could actually walk to you and talk to you, and Syria had a completely different opinion right.
10:46:31 That is a very hotly like in your research space. Right. And we currently don't know we we have assumed that people simply like generally we like toys we like things to play with right so if there are things that tactile if there's a robot by my phone
10:46:49 that I can touch, touch, I can like you know move with and so on and so forth with like his story. And we are more likely to engage with it like we used to play with toys when were younger, right.
10:47:05 So that's, that's one of the things that are ongoing right on the data side like those very two three years I mean to God.
10:47:22 Some people may feel like, like when they personally framed and really really on the air for depression, they want to be speaking to one individual for example like they want to speak to it restored they want to speak to green, who is who our clinical
10:47:37 and can offer some ideas about like, you know, they feel like these are professional things, right. So, so there's some, some merit to that it meant to, and the research is to open them like you know I want you to keep your eyes open, like in the sense
10:47:53 in your mind when you think about the impact of the AI, sorry so machines how AI solutions and no one can have their format in which we deploy their their physicality we give it, whether we presented as a chat bot, with no personality, with our present
10:48:05 as a child with a disability, like you know, and even if it's with a personality what it can do their functions, they can perform and so on and so forth on whether we realize that, you know, for my impact on how, like Luda shake the way we went.
10:48:24 Right.
10:48:24 For example, if you think about an office where you place for example, that the office copier machine. You know, we determine a lot that kind of relationships that are built like amongst employees right there is research that's things that people who
10:48:40 are close to their.
10:48:43 close to their. The photocopy machine or the printer for example, like they tend to be more determined to make more friends with everyone in the organization, than people who are further away from, from what we believe that photocopy machine, all the
10:48:57 right so some of these physical devices, they have implications for dancers, like in the management system management they have a for dancers dancers that they create based on their location, and body the body, in terms of different answers that you need
10:49:17 to take care of.
10:49:18 To keep, keep in mind.
10:49:20 Okay.
10:49:22 Okay. do we have any questions.
10:49:25 Otherwise I want us to focus on a page on robots, I think you know a lot more about these robots and I do.
10:49:34 But for the sake of Brie.
10:49:37 Sorry.
10:49:50 For the sake of retirees.
10:49:42 Can someone briefly describe, like a working definition, like of what a robot is that many people have different definitions for robots.
10:50:04 Can someone briefly talk about what you've discovered so far in your MMA junkie, or before, or in your other readings, about what a robot is.
10:50:07 Any volunteers.
10:50:10 Yes, my show.
10:50:13 Yeah, so just simply I think it's just like a, it's like an automated machine that can, that is designed to execute specific tasks with barely or very little or no human intervention and with like speed and position and quality.
10:50:32 Yeah. So, for the idea, thank you myself. The idea is that, you know, it automatically accomplished accomplished. So, typically with the help of software right so last software could be AI, or in some cases, you know, it does not necessarily have to be.
10:50:51 But what we are realizing like that, that the thing that is common across board is that they have two things.
10:51:03 The environmental effect.
10:51:03 If you remember, I showed you a slide from I think last.
10:51:17 The winter term, where I was showing you all the different things that are intelligent system we supposed to do. And one of them was affecting the environment right so so this idea of things to that effect and it's why robots are tied to the join with
10:51:26 With a right. And we are moving more from A to B to non performing repetitive tasks to autonomy bank self initiation tasks. This is why robots are becoming more important, more like popular these these The, the, the haven't been like they're not a new
10:51:45 invention about you know robots that we don't seem to realize now. I mean, the, the manufacturing factories are using robots to automate tasks for very long time for decades and decades right.
10:52:02 Jolie resume why robots are much more popular now, because after 2012 or 2013, after the big leap, that was done in deep learning, and like reinforcement learning and all of these different service reports, you know now, you know, came into being and
10:52:27 have all these naturalistic, how they call it feel right, their interaction capabilities, I know you know these kind of things, you know, in the last decade, if you like, you know, a lot of advancements that have allowed, you know, robots to get closer,
10:52:41 you know to step out of the manufacturing flows and come and live amongst us if you like right and that's why like you know more and more.
10:52:56 We are thinking about deploying them whenever we are thinking about AI solutions, we have to consider whether it makes sense to deploy it as a
10:53:05 form of a robot right. So I put down some like you know, robust two different things and of course they have different components, but in all of them have some specific component.
10:53:14 This is, like, you know, these, these things more for Iris embryo myself, you know, we need to touch upon these have expected that many of you are already ahead of the curve on on these things so I don't want to spend too much time.
10:53:30 But if you haven't.
10:53:31 This is an important part of going forward like you know we, some of the studies that are beginning to come out, I suggested that robotics are like, how are moving out of manufacturing services and we did not realize this is very interesting.
10:53:48 We already seen a lot like since I was talking about robots that serve food, and so on and so forth right so so it's something that you need to keep on your agenda especially service robots which we we tend to be more interested, right,
10:54:04 that there are different types of robots or categories of robots.
10:54:09 Robots which, you know, are programmed to perform the same task repetitively and that's what happens.
10:54:15 Like that's how it started like you know, especially in the manufacturing brands things and so forth. And then there are cookbooks you know where, you know, I, instead of just performing, you know, setting tasks you know they are designed to collaborate,
10:54:30 as humans, you know, we do stuff sprite that you can think about standalone robots to, You know who able to light and modify your behavior.
10:54:41 you know, using reinforcement learning, basically, right.
10:54:45 You got to think about remote control robots and and all this kind of thing but, you know, the, the big thing right now is industrial versus service robots right.
10:54:57 That's a big distinction in there in the literature. And so, for the service robots like. There are many many more applications like you know done well maybe, maybe we don't know like.
10:55:13 There are there are many many more industrial applications or proposal service robots but the opportunity for growth. And for those of you enter printer aisle and thinking about the things you would do with your
10:55:32 courses NLP classes and your, your, your architecture your deep learning classes, right, you know, you should be focusing more on 30 strip or designing solutions for service robots are designing.
10:55:41 If you do reinforcement learning for example like you know how to, you know, use those different architectures you know to to come up with something new, right, whether that's where the interest of time in and that's where the opportunities are what organizations
10:55:55 but like I said, There's a lot of literature, you know, categorizing, everybody that does somebody the James, and how we position our own track of this, I put this slide there just you know to give you some ideas of some popular robots that are in place
10:56:24 so I don't want to spend too much time on it but you can't let go back to with a pen and expand the list. Later, if you want, but I want to discuss briefly, my machine collaboration.
10:56:40 Right. And, and some of the things that we need to keep an eye on.
10:57:00 So, if you look at this picture that we have on the screen now. We have pepper robot, which is one of the robots I just described in the, in the previous slide, and you can read about a very popular but type of robot says another round table me meeting
10:57:02 with humans. What do you think is going on here.
10:57:10 What do you think is going on here. You're just having a meeting but do you think, I'm sorry. Sorry. do you think the robot is there as well as the Secretary as there what what happened in here yes I mean.
10:57:30 Well actually, I would say, this one is going to serve a very specific purpose for instance for this meeting is going to take notes or something like doing some assistance and support that.
10:57:41 This is not a general purpose rowboats or this is like just a specific purpose. I will say, Okay, well.
10:57:57 Who else can we have my my opinion.
10:58:00 Yes, Catherine.
10:58:03 Um, I guess the robot kx, like, I'm sorry, like in some ways like you ask them certain questions that could be fine aligned. and then the robots can provide a pretty efficient way.
10:58:17 In, like back seat hiding the meeting process by providing this information, of course.
10:58:24 Okay.
10:58:28 Myself.
10:58:32 Yeah, I think it's there for, for better human interaction and is able to engage with people through conversations. So I think, based on the group meeting default be having discussions about a certain topic.
10:58:41 So he's able to, you know, be available and take, I guess the edge to add on Ali's, take notes and engage through having a conversation. Okay. All right.
10:58:55 Good mediator function. Media function. Okay.
10:58:59 So media out there that the, the temperature in the room rises too high. Yeah.
10:59:08 Calm down, tell people to calm down. Yeah What's won't work but you know.
10:59:14 Okay.
10:59:15 Yes.
10:59:18 A Winston.
10:59:20 So I've seen this in TV shows like they're representing just humorously.
10:59:25 So they have robots to standing for for a human for a person, some employee couldn't come in shift and they use a robot, and the robot can walk around engaging people like with like the camera footage of that person on the other end, It's probably not
10:59:42 the case here, but it's
10:59:50 interesting.
10:59:48 interesting.
11:00:03 And thank you for bringing that up. So imagine like think about the dynamics right. I thank you for confirming only.
11:00:00 Everybody who contributed to this. Imagine that you had, like, building on one shoes point, imagine that the robot is representing the CEO of the organization.
11:00:12 How do you think people compare themselves around the robot in terms of engaging and in terms of speaking in terms of how do you think, what do you think will happen.
11:00:21 Like if he was the CEO if it was represented as you have the meeting, versus if he was representing, let's say, a colleague or junior colleague.
11:00:36 So, so bring it on feels that the that the robot shoot.
11:00:57 Alyssa different reactions right based on, you know, whether it's representing legends been just there for example to take notes and and so on and so forth.
11:00:52 How do people change their behavior. right, people might noun, like you know,
11:00:59 instead of being like you for humanity sticky notes, you have to be very clear in your articulation right. If the robot is taking notes you assume that it's probably recording everything you're saying, so you're not so clear like you can you can, you
11:01:15 know, you can relax in terms of clarity of ideas and so on and so forth.
11:01:20 In the robots is representing the CEO, then you realize that whenever people are talking. They don't want to talk about everybody, they want to cut the reward.
11:01:29 I didn't know that is representing you know what's going on here is a bit beyond like you know just the reverse it in the right. So the idea here is that whenever we we put, like, the way robots are beginning to invade the workplace.
11:01:45 And this is like this is not fixing this is actually things that are happening in real organizations I know why should you said you were some Comic Relief stuff, but they are happening in places like in some restaurants you have robots like you naturally
11:02:00 come in to save you in some airports your robots actually, you know, meeting you, after you to stand your ticket, they can take you all the way to your, your data set and so for those of you who fly through, through that a lot you know you may have come
11:02:16 know, the, the rk robots and so on and so forth. Right. So, the question that is assuming that this rule but it's like it's not taking notes and so on and so forth.
11:02:30 Right. It's not taking notes but let's say I see you're like, acting in the capacity of see you all on its own capacity like assume that it was conscious.
11:02:44 When you remember the case, we had last week that you have let's say you had a lambda, like you know, everybody, as a robot sitting with you in this meeting with all of its mountain of knowledge.
11:02:56 Right contributing to discussions you bring up the topic, you know you can name any topic and you can hear that, you know, if alumni certain lambda or any of the GP three models Delhi or any of the language models that are really far advanced right now
11:03:12 that are claiming consciousness. Right. you know, you can imagine how the composition will flow. Right. You can imagine your custom mind back to the discussion we had last week or the readings you did last week.
11:03:30 Right. By the way our first ever load.
11:03:38 Last week's class, you know, for you to catch up on for some of the concepts. You know, I'm trying to catch up on it. But think about it, right. If you end up making a decision at that a robot is involved.
11:03:45 How do we want to, what does like, how do we are pushing responsibility for that.
11:03:52 That has been taking, we should be held responsible if it's a good.
11:03:57 Is it because the robot such as ideas that you guys from the humans followed, it means the bad decision isn't because the robots are just some ideas that they don't do the I'm saying so.
11:04:11 So what we have robots involved in our decision making, like not robots per se but AI, like the embodiment doesn't matter, I'm just using the robot in this case because like it's very glad to show you know that it's, it's at the table to right, but it
11:04:28 could be a disembodied, it could be, like, you know, I talked about something that is not everybody, right, you know, might be involved in that.
11:04:39 We now have to consider the responsibility. Sorry, what it means for responsibility, right next week when we talk about impact of organizations that feature works out of the things we.
11:04:53 I'm hoping that we can be able to cover will look at what responsibility now means for employees, and how we now have to evaluate their performance. Because if we have collectively make a decision, right, we have cooperate like we have collaborated with
11:05:10 an AI to make a decision, and the outcome of that decision. You know, doesn't go well.
11:05:19 Is that human to be held responsible, or how responsive, where do we draw the line, and it becomes Larry, if we have robots like tap there as human it was conscious you're sitting at a table and have been unconscious to bid or composition with us, right.
11:05:35 So at that point, we don't really care whether it's conscious or not, because it keeps giving us information that seems to be prompted us in a certain direction.
11:05:46 Right. And this is what what I meant by last week when we said, we talked about whether we should care, like why we should care whether or not that is the outcome that is the most important and how do you how do those who are interacting with a robot
11:06:02 feel. Do they feel that it is conscious living it is not fun shows that they walk away with the thinking that this thing could be conscious that practically we have tells you that it's conscious and start taking steps and measures to make sure that if
11:06:21 we, we are comfortable with working with conscious, non human be. Then we we deal with that, if we are comfortable working with that as well. Then we recognize the potential repercussions and deal with it.
11:06:32 Accordingly, right so so that was there.
11:06:35 The main point I wanted to make with this with this slide.
11:06:39 Do we have any questions.
11:06:44 Okay.
11:06:46 The other thing I want to talk about, about human machine collaborations has to do with the type of collaboration that we have, right.
11:06:58 So, one of the frameworks that AI people haven't yet started thinking about when they talk about human machine collaboration. But, like we have, we have done a lot of research and information systems, we've spent a lot of time on this type of thing with
11:07:16 how technology, you know, task interdependence, right. So, so you have to think about, you know, how we perform in a typical organization. We can perform tasks from a tools perspective right you know we have, like, three perform tasks, one myself there
11:07:36 two, and three, and then we'll pull them together to get their job done right, we get the job done through that. That means that Syria will do part one and pass it on to my show and then myself who will perform tasks to, which means tough one to perform
11:07:56 you know, she can do her, and then pass it on to part three to four right, then you have the reciprocal and then you get a different this or that different ways that we actually do we perform tasks dependent on each other in organizations right.
11:08:13 And the way because niche amongst these different interdependence games is that we have to consider standardization, like when it's up to, like we are going to pull different tasks right independent test, or we have to plan for sickle cell trait you know
11:08:43 Right. But if you're always thinking about, you know, you have to evaluate my way to get into you get it and give me feedback so that I can improve it, and so on and so forth.
11:08:53 Right.
11:08:53 And then we move on. And then, if it's a team that we have to schedule meetings or how to pursue that. So the complexity increases, the more coordination we need right.
11:09:05 So, once we bring an AI to the picture.
11:09:10 I wanted the question I have for you is, if you consider these different types of workloads very soon.
11:09:19 What I'm hoping what for water to make a decision making contest, we think machines work alone, or human should work alone No we should have human in the loop so you might need.
11:09:31 You know what that concept is right. The idea that those that human who decides, like you know before they act like the robot from the human before he does what he does.
11:09:47 And if you manage the loop is that there's a human involved all right buddy I will do what they have to do without waiting for approval. Right. So, so, the human can only pull the plug.
11:09:59 You know if he or she, they absolutely believe that you know something wrong is going to happen right, so we're looking at this lady from ways that, you know, we could be working with machines, which are this life or what automated decision making, contest
11:10:13 Do you think this, this new brand configurations are best suited for any ideas.
11:10:23 Yes. Oh, jack.
11:10:26 Good to hear from you today.
11:10:31 Hi. Yeah. So, basically first credentials.
11:10:36 I would say that the machine, working alone will be perfect in this kind of scenarios, because for the sequential kind of workflow.
11:10:46 Like the machine can do those kind of repetitive tasks that does not require monitoring in that kind of way, the machine working along could be well suitable for like kind of sequential kind of type of works.
11:10:59 And, and also in the same scenario, having the post ball. So the machine in humans working along for individual tasks, then it was being aggregated, but for the task along, it will be consider is they're working on their own autonomous, but before.
11:11:16 Yeah, definitely before the aggregation happens, and also like they're just typically in teams. I would say definitely need humans in the loop, because it definitely requires a constant states of feeding information.
11:11:32 if I understand human in the loop correctly.
11:11:35 Yeah.
11:11:36 And the way I understand human on the loop is a conscious overseas it but it doesn't interfere with the word.
11:11:45 Yeah, yeah so so football I guess for the aggregation part like human on the loop could be kind of an add on voice for the final decisions. after getting all those informations.
11:11:59 So, I guess it will be a combination of collaborations, instead of like using one to singly identify one, I guess for stage of the workflow is ok ok so you think about it based on their maturity of the work, or the yeah okay I get your point.
11:12:20 Thank you. Any other ideas.
11:12:26 Any other ideas. Yes.
11:12:28 Anytime there's a feedback loop that's happening like humans need to be in, like, Generally, or maybe AI right now.
11:12:38 Humans need some involvement.
11:12:40 So I think we're reciprocal and team maybe one of them can be in the loop and one of them can be on the loop.
11:12:46 So I mean team would require in because there's a lot of interconnectivity.
11:12:52 So my question to you that is Syria.
11:12:58 Are you suggesting that it is not possible for teams of robots to work alone.
11:13:15 Two teams of robot to work and coordinate all teams of the I, like, you know, I keep going back to robot but I hope you know what I'm trying to say it's easier to, you know, relate to their physicality of robots right but can we have teams of AI weekend
11:13:31 like in swamp intelligence right for example, I think they are. It's just dependent on the past great that we can have a team of robots, working completely autonomously without a human on the loop, SharePoint SharePoint, there are tasks that I'm not,
11:13:47 I'm not. I, I do
11:13:57 buying something. Right. Anyways, but I see I get your point is traffic intelligence. Exactly. Parking Lot intelligence exactly like traffic intelligence for example like we, we really need a noun AI is at a place where we really need to intervene, right,
11:14:21 backup systems that can take care of these things right. But, but if I wrote point like one of the things that like thank you jack can answer yeah and
11:14:33 one of the, one of the, the things that you also need to consider would be the impact of the outcome, right. So, sometimes like when it comes to by us, dealing with payouts for example, or some of the ethical conversations that we have.
11:14:53 Yeah, it has proved more and more over and over that it is unable to, to take those decisions, like you know for us to to consider those factors, on behalf of humans, right.
11:15:05 So, so that's where, like, you know, human involvement. You know, it's always gonna be depending on the type like irrespective of a task. There's always gonna be the need to think about a decision context or the impact on the business outcomes like it
11:15:21 especially from an ethical perspective as well as some people are being unfairly like treated or the outcome is like, you know, bias against some, some group of people and so on and so forth, or the outcome will be rejected as well as before, right.
11:15:36 So, so you need to go to your first we need to start from the task.
11:15:50 If we start from the task, it will become very clear that, you know, our assumptions about that we need a lot of rethinking. Right. And then once we we start we go beyond it has realized that that was part of the, of the collaboration to then like you
11:16:01 know we realized that we cannot avoid humans no matter. Like, no matter how well we design systems to be able to wake like you know we design AI solutions be able to read together, you know to coordinate themselves.
11:16:18 Women need humans, at some point, right, if there is outcomes, you know, are going to be problematic right.
11:16:27 So that's something to keep in mind. Right.
11:16:30 The last bit of stuff. I have on the slides, I'm not gonna go into details into them. But I talk about different systems that can because they are tournaments, right, they may not be AI yet, but we've been designed like we've had SBC systems,
11:16:52 who is familiar with these systems, anybody.
11:16:57 is familiar with these systems, anybody. Has anybody, is anybody familiar with persuasive design, and Communication Design Principles.
11:17:07 Okay, so I would like I would strongly encourage you to read about these things.
11:17:11 I put some stuff here.
11:17:15 So, so proficiency systems basically are designing it as a pack so if you like software systems right, you know, try to encourage people to perform certain behaviors, right.
11:17:28 So for example if you want people to stop smoking.
11:17:32 Like if you want people to stop smoking, for example, there are things that we've thought about like in terms of looking at the key issues involved. The persuasive context the intentions the painting the strategies and so forth, and how to design system
11:17:46 to support you know different aspect of the tasks involved right.
11:17:51 to support you know different aspect of the tasks involved right. So these are not. We have not traditionally thought about this as, as a person. But if you consider what the objectives of these types of systems. Yeah, pretty much similar to what AI system
11:18:04 Yeah, pretty much similar to what AI systems, great to do these days in terms of helping objectives, right. So, there's a lot of literature on this.
11:18:13 There's a lot of factors, in terms of covering that ground longing for example like you know how some of these systems way, right, for example like for me.
11:18:28 system in in health for example, you could be given our rewards for performing certain behaviors right you could be introducing competition. It also show comparison you know too much bigger performance of such as you know to to motivate their performance
11:18:42 of others, and so forth. All of these each one of these, you know, different
11:18:55 techniques have been researched and vetted and deployed several times, those of you play games actually some of these design ideas, some of them actually coming from Ghibli right, you know, when you points, you know for achieving certain behaviors and
11:19:20 So, I feel like we are a stage where I am beginning to intersect, and many other things that you may find us in these types of systems.
11:19:36 For those of you who are looking for entrepreneurial opportunities you might find that there are a lot of opportunities here, you know, to develop new products, you know, for existing problems like better products right like you know differentiation Yo,
11:19:51 yo, yo.
11:19:53 Yes, sir. Yeah.
11:19:55 I was gamification AI.
11:19:57 Isn't that just know I'm not saying gamification is AI know I'm saying that gamification some of the principles that we've been using so far. I trying to achieve some level objectives to what AI, like, you know, a founder AI we have our trying to achieve.
11:20:29 terms of humans to perform certain types of behaviors or getting motivating humans to do more of something and less of for these are
11:20:29 trying to do, and I'm trying to draw attention to them education for example as one of the ways of addressing this need.
11:20:39 They are trying to do this is a bit shallow shallow theory.
11:20:45 Quite a lot of design ideas, those a lot more that I've researched in gamification right.
11:20:52 They got the kitchen area, and also I'm saying that you know if you delve into this room awake, you will start seeing the connections between what you do what this document in nominees are my classes and LTE and also deep learning and then we are by causes,
11:21:07 we are by causes, taking with me and other pros and, you know, the stuff that you know that the ideas that I've been existing here. Some of the things they know the design principles here, we have not been able to successfully because of.
11:21:24 We like the right tools, but it can be true, right. So, I'm going to this. And now, surely encourage you to, to, to pay attention to that. I think I want to bring the class to it and I had a few more slides from my systems that are a little crusty.
11:21:46 We'll talk about that next next class. Before we started the class I'll go through those things for us to see for us to see what it means for the AI solutions that we have.
11:21:59 Right. So, so let's skip this for now.
11:22:04 And next week we'll have a three hour seminar about it, and then I'll try. I'll try my best, you know, to, to, to put the grades for kids to have so that you know where you stand on those things.
11:22:20 Go to class, so please take note, and I'll send an email about reading progressions. All right. So, do we have any more questions, otherwise we can close soon.
11:22:35 Do we have.
11:22:36 David is actually have a question.
11:22:39 a, so we're probably prompting to, to, to start our research paper later. So we just want to know like when roughly we think that the feedback on our proposal.
11:22:51 That's I'm saying, I said that I owe you a lot of dating.
11:22:54 And I'm going to do that this week.
11:22:59 I start sending you things that we have to have to be done next week, at least.
11:23:09 You're gonna get feedback on the research proposal and.
11:23:19 Okay, minimum minimum like you know give you feedback on those.
11:23:22 All right. Awesome.
11:23:24 Thank you.
11:23:31 All right. Okay.
11:23:33 Any more questions. So I'm going to pause and slice of the class.
11:23:40 And then you can take a look at them. It does anything that was not clear.
11:23:45 Because we are not in comparison. You can email me about it or you can write it down and we can revisit it, next, next, next week. Okay.
11:23:55 Okay.
11:23:57 All right, so the journey plan for, I think you would prepare the notes and then you do.
